# Albert Fullstack Code Test
This task is not designed to be difficult. It is mainly tailored for us to gain insights into your way of thinking and working. Therefore, your level of ambition decides how much effort you put into it. The timebox we recommend is 2-3 hours. 

Feel free to use your favorite IDE, latest and greatest open source libraries and tools, and any online resource you'd like to solve the problem, as long as you do not copy-paste code.

# The task
Your main task is to integrate a web site written in React with a backend in Node.js with the external Star Wars API (https://swapi.py4e.com/)

1. Create an app from a template or from scratch. Use React, Node.js, and TypeScript.
2. Set up integration with the external Star Wars API from the backend. Your frontend should only use the backend using custom APIs.
3. Create a page where you display a list of People from the movies with name, age, and a couple of other basic properties about the person.
    * User should be able to sort the list by name and age
    * List should have pagination
    * Data for the list should be cached on the backend as it does not change very often.
4. User should be able to click the name of the Person and transition to a Person page, where you display some basic properties and information about which species they belong to.

Once done, please also upload a short video showing the final results in a browser.

# Optional Tasks
* Write automated tests for the code.
* Implement responsive design.
* Use Redux (that's what we use for all our apps and the web).
* Create a jawdropping design.

And finally, please help us improve by sending us much welcomed feedback!
